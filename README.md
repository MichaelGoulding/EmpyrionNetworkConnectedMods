# Introduction
This is a wrapper for the Empyrion Mod API and a system to run mods without having to restart the game server.  It uses the existing TCP port used by EAH to connect to the game server.

# Getting Started

## Build
1.  Clone the code (recursively to include submodules).  Don't just download a .zip of the code.
2.  Load up in Visual Studio 2017
3.  Build all.

 ## Run
After building, the \NetworkConnectedModRunner\bin\Release (or Debug) folder will contain the .exe which will load an run any *Mod.dll found in the Extensions folder (or 1 folder deeper).
Make sure you configure the Settings.yaml file to point to the API port used by EAH.

# Included mods
| Module | Description |
|:-----------|:-----------|
|BankTransferMod| Lets players transfer funds to each other. |
| FactionStorageMod | Lets players in the same faction access a shared storage area. |
| NoKillZonesMod | Lets admins jail and release players from a configured jail location.  Also puts players in jail who kill other players in "protected" areas. |

| StarterShipMod | Grants each player a one-time ship. |
| StarterCreditsMod | Grants each player a one-time award of credits. |
| StructureOwnershipMod | It gives periodic rewards to any faction that captures the core of configured ships/buildings. You then use /income to take out the items you've earned. The idea is that it gives purpose in PVP to take over bases in space/planet. It also reduce the need to use autominers as you could capture a "steel block" factory or something. |

| FactionPlayfieldKickerMod| (Deprecated as it's a part of EAH now) Keeps people not belonging to a specifc faction out of a playfield if they try to warp in. |
